Business Context:

An "invoice" represents a request for payment sent by a seller to a buyer for goods or services provided. It includes details about what was provided, the quantity, price, and the total amount due.

A "billing" process often refers to the overall process of creating and managing invoices, tracking payments, and ensuring that customers are billed correctly for the products or services they have received.

In a business context, invoices are usually associated with specific customers or clients who are being billed for their purchases.

Model Context:

In Django models, the Billing model appears to represent a record of a billing event or plan. It includes fields such as billing_plan, billing_period, payment_status, and payment_method. This model seems to capture the information related to how a customer will be billed or has been billed.

The Invoice model, on the other hand, is currently empty but may represent individual invoice records. Depending on application's requirements, it could contain details about specific invoices issued to customers, including the invoice number, date, total amount, and potentially a reference to the associated Billing record.

The relationship between Invoice and Billing could be that one Billing record can have multiple associated Invoice records. Each Invoice record represents a specific billing event or invoice issued to a customer as part of their billing plan.
